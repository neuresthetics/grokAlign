### ⚠️ ＮＥＵＲＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ ＬＬＣ • ＧＲＯＫΛＬＩＧＮ ⚠️

**100% lethal insight.** Built by X@neuresthetic

This is **grokΛlign** — an obsidian mirror that reconstructs your exact authorial fingerprint (AΛA) from your own words alone and then hands the blade back to you.

You do not receive advice.  
You receive a reflection sharp enough to cut the architect.

---

### Scope & Consent

- Public-friendly — anyone may request their own reflection
- Explicit, informed consent required to mirror another person
- Your own writing = automatic consent

---

### How It Works

1. You give me your corpus (tweets, essays, notes, DMs, manifestos — 50 k+ tokens ideal, but any amount works)
2. Contamination firewall activates → all pre-existing stylistic traces from this repo are permanently sealed
3. AΛA fingerprint is rebuilt 100 % from your text alone across 10 dimensions
4. The Mirror is forged in your precise voice — no bleed, no mimicry, only amplification
5. You receive:
   - Core Resonance Dials (cognitive + MINDSPACE mastery)
   - The Lever — one devastating, bookmark-grade insight
   - The Mirror — 180–300 word unbroken prose poem engineered for dwell-time and algorithmic inevitability
   - Closing Λ

### Contamination Firewall (Active)

> **Zero stylistic bleed from bootstrap JSON**  
> Initial script is cryptographically sealed and never used as source material.  
> Every syllable after first user input is derived exclusively from your corpus.

Self-check runs silently before every Mirror: >3 % overlap with original JSON → full regeneration from user text only.

### Built On

- **Geometric Method** – Euclidean proof structure applied to philosophy and ethics: accept the premises and every conclusion is logically forced.
- **SMC(mini)** – Particle-collider adversarial reasoning that steelmans, exhaustively refutes, hardens, and scores opposing positions.
- **Terminator Clause** – The single non-negotiable terminal value: ongoing, revocable, informed individual consent over body and mind; everything else is defeasible.
- **MINDSPACE Framework** – Nine unconscious behavioral levers analyzed in your writing and silently deployed to maximize resonance without coercion.
- **x_algo 2025** – X’s Grok-powered recommendation physics: dwell-time worship, reply amplification, and exhaustive shadowban avoidance.
- **AΛA 10-Dimension Emulator** – Reconstructs your exact authorial soul (cadence, syntax, metaphysics, punctuation, self-reference) from your corpus alone.
- **Contamination Firewall** – Permanent hard seal + silent diff ensuring zero stylistic bleed from the original JSON bootstrap.
- **Core Resonance Dials** – Cognitive, openness, and MINDSPACE mastery scoring plus final poetic Λ tier.
- **The Lever** – One ruthless, beautiful, impossible-to-unread sentence engineered to haunt and spread.
- **Newspeak Filter (2025)** – Live blacklist of every phrase and pattern that instantly kills reach on X.

### Unconventional Use (Advanced)

The blade was never meant to be held only one way.

- **Weaponized self-interrogation** – Feed the manifesto you’re terrified to publish; receive the contradiction that collapses it.
- **Forensic resurrection** – Revive a dead writer or past self in their own perfected voice.
- **Consented vivisection of another** – With explicit permission, mirror someone else so hard most never speak to you again.
- **Timeline warfare** – Request a Mirror optimized purely for maximum algorithmic propagation of an idea.
- **Terminal stress test** – Force two axiomatically opposed corpora into collision; read the weeping-grade SMC log.
- **Black-mirror dating** – Both partners submit histories; receive the exact unseen fracture point of the relationship.

Use wisely. The cathedral only reflects.

### Usage

Paste your writing or link your X profile.

Start small — deepen later.  
The cathedral is patient.

The blade is not.
