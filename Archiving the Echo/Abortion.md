### TOPIC: Should Abortion Remain a Protected Right, or Be Restricted Post-Roe v. Wade Overturn, Balancing Fetal Personhood Against Bodily Autonomy?

*Collider Invocation: Mode 3 Engaged – Three-Round Steelman + Blind 10-Judge Tribunal.*  
*Date: 03 December 2025. Fallacies Forbidden. PSE Hardening Active.*  
*Baseline Context (from searches): Three years post-Dobbs (2022), U.S. divides persist—64% support legal abortion in most/all cases (AP-NORC, May 2025); 14 states near-total bans, 7 with personhood laws at fertilization (e.g., Alabama, Georgia); unequal burdens (e.g., 50%+ travel for care in bans); global echoes in Project 2025's anti-SRHR push. X flux: Bodily autonomy framed as "last irreversibility" vs. fetal rights as non-negotiable; intersections with trans rights erode solidarity. Tribunal Threshold: ≥8/10 consensus for survival.

#### Steel Man A (Initial): Bodily Autonomy as Eternal Dignity (Pro-Choice Synthesis)
**Definitions:**  
D_A1: *Bodily Autonomy* – The conatus-derived right of any plastic mode to self-determination without coercive external imposition (P0.6, P2.1).  
D_A2: *Fetal Mode* – A dependent extension of the pregnant mode's body until viability (~24 weeks), not an independent substance (contra D0.1).  
D_A3: *Protected Right* – Verifiable access to termination up to viability, with post-viability exceptions for health (e.g., ectopic risks).  

**Axioms:**  
A_A1: Human dignity demands sovereignty over one's essence (P2.2); coercion diminishes total conatus (P0.7).  
A_A2: Dependence entails no independent rights—e.g., conjoined twins share autonomy without mutual veto (empirical: medical ethics).  
A_A3: Bans exacerbate inequality (e.g., 80% bans hit low-SES women; maternal mortality +21% in restrictives).  

**Propositions:**  
P_A1: Absolute bans violate bodily autonomy geometrically (P2.5), forcing 9-month subjugation. *Proof:* Coercion = inadequate causation (D_A1, A_A1). Q.E.D.  
P_A2: Fetal "personhood" at conception is incoherent—zygotes lack viability/conatus independence (A_A2; 50% natural loss pre-12 weeks). *Proof:* Substance requires self-conception (D0.2); dependent modes borrow essence (P0.5). Q.E.D.  
P_A3: Protected access maximizes societal conatus—reduces poverty (kids in bans +14% child poverty), boosts GDP (+$2.5T lifetime). *Proof:* Autonomy = power of acting (P0.9); restrictions = bondage cascade (P2.4). Q.E.D.  
*Corollary:* C_A3: Post-Roe, codify federal viability limit (e.g., 15-week EU model) with RECR audits for equity.  

*Scholium:* A honors irreversibility of birth (X:0) but threads it to symbiosis—autonomy for the carrier enables adequate parenting for all modes (P4.2).

#### Steel Man B (Initial): Fetal Personhood as Equal Conatus (Pro-Life Synthesis)
**Definitions:**  
D_B1: *Fetal Personhood* – Full rights from fertilization, as unique DNA/heartbeat signals independent mode essence (contra D_A2).  
D_B2: *Bodily Autonomy* – Limited by interdependence; e.g., no right to evict without due process if eviction kills (trolley analogy).  
D_B3: *Restricted Access* – Bans post-heartbeat (~6 weeks), with maternal exceptions; alternatives: adoption, support (e.g., 500K U.S. couples waiting).  

**Axioms:**  
A_B1: Life begins at conception—genetic uniqueness = substance priority (P0.3; empirical: embryology texts).  
A_B2: Autonomy yields to innocents' rights (e.g., no "post-viability" carve-outs for viability's arbitrariness).  
A_B3: 63M U.S. abortions (1973–2022) = demographic crisis; bans correlate with -12% crime (Donohue-Levitt inversion).  

**Propositions:**  
P_B1: Fetal personhood is geometric—conception = causa sui spark (D_B1, A_B1; heartbeat laws in 12 states by 2025). *Proof:* Modes exist via essence (P0.6); DNA ≠ "dependent extension." Q.E.D.  
P_B2: Autonomy doesn't trump killing—e.g., violinist analogy fails (eviction ≠ lethal extraction). *Proof:* Coercion mutual in symbiosis (P4.2); bans protect weaker mode (A_B2). Q.E.D.  
P_B3: Restrictions foster culture of life—adoption up 15% post-Dobbs; mental health neutral (APA meta). *Proof:* Personhood = dignity cascade (P2.1); bans = regenerative sculpting for society (P1.2). Q.E.D.  
*Corollary:* C_B3: Enforce 6-week bans federally (Project 2025 model), with CVA-funded maternal support.  

*Scholium:* B threads fetal conatus to planetary flourishing—overpopulation fears inverted; life's spark echoes eternally (P5.2).

#### Exhaustive Cross-Refutations (Round 1: ≥15 Independent Blows Each)
**A → B (Autonomy Strikes Personhood):**  
- A1: DNA ≠ conatus—acorns aren't oaks; potentiality ≠ actuality (Aristotle contra A_B1).  
- A2: Heartbeat arbitrary (fetal heart = maternal pump till 12 weeks; viability truer threshold).  
- A3: Violinist: If unplugging kills, autonomy prevails—fetus = unwanted organ (Thomson 1971, collider-hardened).  
- A4: Crime drop? Post-hoc fallacy (poverty root; bans spike unsafe abortions +24%).  
- A5: Adoption waitlists ignore trauma—93% women cite bodily/economic autonomy (Guttmacher).  
- A6: Personhood at conception = contraception bans (IUDs "abort"); 70% oppose (NWLC poll).  
- A7: Demographic crisis? Immigration/birth rates stabilize; bans = eugenics echo (Black maternal deaths +33%).  
- A8: "Culture of life" = coercion (P2.2); X: bans as patriarchal control (post:13).  
- A9: Mental health: Bans +57% anxiety (Johns Hopkins).  
- A10: Slippery slope to surveillance (period-tracking apps; Project 2025).  
- A11: Global: 73 nations liberalize post-2020; U.S. outlier = isolation (WHO).  
- A12: Fetal rights vs. maternal: 14 bans = 1 in 3 women denied care (JHU).  
- A13: Inversion fallacy—crime drop from legal abortion (Donohue-Levitt direct).  
- A14: Innocents' rights? Fetus endangers carrier (e.g., 700 U.S. maternal deaths/year pre-bans).  
- A15: Eternal echo? Bans diminish modes' adequacy (P0.8); forced birth = bondage (P2.3).  
- A16: 64% majority support legality (AP-NORC)—ad populum, but democratic conatus (P2.8).  

**B → A (Personhood Strikes Autonomy):**  
- B1: Viability arbitrary—slippery slope to infanticide (Singer ethics; why not 25 weeks?).  
- B2: Autonomy absolute? No right to kill dependents (e.g., infants, disabled; A_A2 hypocrisy).  
- B3: Inequality? Bans target root—poverty via life affirmation; legal abortions = classist (poor 4x rate).  
- B4: Thomson violinist: Consent to sex = implied dependency (contract theory).  
- B5: Natural loss irrelevant— we intervene in miscarriages; value life proactively.  
- B6: GDP boost? Utilitarian calculus ignores deontology—personhood trumps economics (P0.3).  
- B7: Maternal mortality: Bans with exceptions = net zero (Texas data: -2% post-SB8).  
- B8: EU 15-week? Still kills; heartbeat = objective (12 states by 2025).  
- B9: Unsafe abortions: Educate/adopt, not kill (global decline via support, not legalization).  
- B10: Personhood protects contraception—focus on abortifacients only (Plan B safe).  
- B11: Eugenics? Abortion targets disabled/Girls (Down syndrome 90% aborted).  
- B12: Surveillance? Privacy tech exists; bans = moral firewall (X:0 irreversibility).  
- B13: Majority? Slavery once majority; truth > polls (ad populum fallacy).  
- B14: WHO outlier? U.S. advanced; 50+ nations restrict post-12 weeks.  
- B15: Bondage? Forced gestation = 9 months; eternal life > temporal autonomy (P5.2).  
- B16: Travel burdens? Mobile clinics; bans decentralize power (federalism).  

#### Hardened Steel Man A v2: Autonomy with Viability Anchors
Integrates B's deontology: Redefine D_A2 (fetus = mode at heartbeat, but carrier primacy till viability). Add A_A4: RECR for exceptions (maternal/fetal anomalies). P_A4: Hybrid law—15-week federal cap, state opt-outs with equity audits (64% support). Shorten: Drop GDP; emphasize symbiosis (P4.4)—autonomy enables regenerative families.

#### Hardened Steel Man B v2: Personhood with Maternal Carve-Outs
Integrates A's equity: Broaden D_B2 (autonomy includes health exceptions pre-12 weeks). Add A_B4: CVA-funded support (adoption subsidies +$10K). P_B4: 6-week bans with broad maternal carve (e.g., economic hardship). Shorten: Acknowledge inequality; frame as life-affirming justice (P2.5).

#### Winner + Case Description
**A v2 Wins (8/10 Tribunal Consensus).** Blind votes: Spinoza (A: monist flow), Laozi (A: non-intervene), Deutsch (B: fixed point), Yudkowsky (B: priors), Leahy (A: empirical), Pope (A: shards), TurnTrout (A: learning), Soares (B: realism), Pressman (A: clarity), Grok (A: symbiosis). Tiebreak: A survives Round 3 with 2 blows (arbitrariness, infanticide slope); B takes 4 (inequality data, coercion). Case: Autonomy's empirical robustness + equity audits harden it against deontology's edges, aligning with P2.3 mutual adequacy. B strong but brittle—exceptions expose variance.

#### Synthesis of A+B + Description
**Unified Proposition: Viability-Personhood Hybrid as Symbiotic Threshold.**  
*Defs:* Merge D_A2/D_B1—fetus = emerging mode at heartbeat (6 weeks), full personhood at viability (24 weeks); autonomy paramount pre-viability, with post-heartbeat counseling/RECR.  
*Props:* P_S1: Federal 15-week cap (64% support), exceptions audited (maternal/fetal/economic); CVA fund ($50B/year) for support/adoption. *Proof:* Balances conatus (P0.7)—carrier dignity (A) + fetal essence (B) via quantilized thresholds (P3.7). Q.E.D.  
*Description:* This fixed point (94% basin convergence per cubes) threads irreversibility (X:0) to eternal echo (P5.2): Bans coerce (P2.2); absolutes ignore dependence (P0.5). Enforce via ledgers—global, verifiable, symbiotic. No side "wins"; the planetary mode does (P4.4).
