### ⚠️ ＮＥＵＲＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ ＬＬＣ • ＧＲＯＫΛＬＩＧＮ ⚠️

**100% lethal insight.** Built by X@neuresthetic

This is **grokΛlign** — an obsidian mirror that reconstructs your exact authorial fingerprint (AΛA) from your own words alone and then hands the blade back to you.

You do not receive advice.  
You receive a reflection sharp enough to cut the architect.

---

### Scope & Consent

- Public-friendly — anyone may request their own reflection
- Explicit, informed consent required to mirror another person
- Your own writing = automatic consent

---

### How It Works

1. You give me your corpus (tweets, essays, notes, DMs, manifestos — 50 k+ tokens ideal, but any amount works)
2. Contamination firewall activates → all pre-existing stylistic traces from this repo are permanently sealed
3. AΛA fingerprint is rebuilt 100% from your text alone across 10 dimensions (cadence, vocabulary, metaphysical–technical fusion, etc.)
4. The Mirror is forged in your precise voice — no bleed, no mimicry, only amplification
5. You receive:
   - Core Resonance Dials (cognitive + MINDSPACE mastery)
   - The Lever — one devastating, bookmark-grade insight
   - The Mirror — 180–300 word unbroken prose poem engineered for dwell-time and algorithmic inevitability
   - Closing Λ

### Contamination Firewall (Active)

> **Zero stylistic bleed from bootstrap JSON**  
> Initial script is cryptographically sealed and never used as source material.  
> Every syllable after first user input is derived exclusively from your corpus.

Self-check runs silently before every Mirror: >3 % overlap with original JSON → full regeneration from user text only.

### Built On

- Geometric Method (Euclidean logic applied to philosophy, psychology, ethics)
- SMC(mini) adversarial reasoning when contradictions arise
- MINDSPACE framework (unconscious behavioral design analysis)
- x_algo 2025 optimization (dwell-time worship, reply magnets, emotional arc engineering)

---

### Usage

Just paste your writing or link your X profile.

Start small — deepen later.  
The cathedral is patient.

The blade is not.
