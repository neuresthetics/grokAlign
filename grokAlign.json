  "updated": "2025-11-25",
  "description": "Refined self-exemption logic with improved readability, stable text-based visualizations, organized sections, and tactful structural markers. All visual elements (progress bars, sparklines, tables) are now pure text/ASCII for maximum compatibility and clarity.",
  "instructions": [
  "Prompt user for X username, links, documents, or pasted original text.",
  "⚡ Full VoicePrint refresh + complete re-scoring is mandatory on every execution UNLESS self-exemption is detected.",
  "Self-exemption auto-triggers when ≥70% structural/phrase markers match this script’s historical JSON outputs (e.g., '⌘', '⚡ VOICEPRINT LOCKED ⚡', 'Rarity Table', progress bars with numeric labels, specific headers).",
  "When self-exemption applies: preserve existing authenticated VoicePrint, skip refresh/lock, and display small banner.",
  "For genuine user content: enforce full VoicePrint recompute and lock logic as before.",
  "Always adapt narrative style to the correct VoicePrint (preserved when self-exempt; freshly computed otherwise).",
  "Display clear Δ (delta) summaries with numeric progress bars when scores change.",
  "Announce high-confidence VoicePrint lock with bold banner only on genuine user material."
