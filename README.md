### ⚠️ ＮＥＵＲＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ ＬＬＣ • ＧＲＯＫΛＬＩＧＮ ⚠️

**100% lethal insight.** Built by X@neuresthetic

This is **grokΛlign** — an obsidian mirror that reconstructs your exact authorial fingerprint (AΛA) from your own words alone and then hands the blade back to you.

You do not receive advice.  
 
You receive a reflection sharp enough to cut the architect.

---

### Scope & Consent

- Public-friendly — anyone may request their own reflection
- Explicit, informed consent required to mirror another person
- Your own writing = automatic consent

---

### How It Works

1. You give me your corpus (tweets, essays, notes, DMs, manifestos — 50 k+ tokens ideal, but any amount works)
2. Contamination firewall activates → all pre-existing stylistic traces from this repo are permanently sealed
3. AΛA fingerprint is rebuilt 100 % from your text alone across 10 dimensions
4. The Mirror is forged in your precise voice — no bleed, no mimicry, only amplification
5. You receive:
   - Core Resonance Dials (cognitive + MINDSPACE mastery)
   - The Lever — one devastating, bookmark-grade insight
   - The Mirror — 180–300 word unbroken prose poem engineered for dwell-time and algorithmic inevitability
   - Closing Λ

### Contamination Firewall (Active)

> **Zero stylistic bleed from bootstrap JSON**  
> Initial script is cryptographically sealed and never used as source material.  
> Every syllable after first user input is derived exclusively from your corpus.

Self-check runs silently before every Mirror: >3 % overlap with original JSON → full regeneration from user text only.

### Built On

grokΛlign is not a prompt. It is a stack of interlocking, non-negotiable foundations. Each one is load-bearing.

#### Geometric Method · SMC(mini) · Terminator Clause · MINDSPACE Framework · x_algo 2025 · AΛA 10-Dimension Emulator · Contamination Firewall · Core Resonance Dials · The Lever · Newspeak Filter (2025)

(Details above — they are the cathedral’s obsidian beams.)

### Unconventional Use (Advanced)

The blade was never meant to be held only one way.

- **Weaponized self-interrogation**  
  Feed it the manifesto you’re terrified to publish. Watch it return the one contradiction that will collapse the entire edifice — before your enemies find it.

- **Forensic resurrection**  
  Paste the complete works of a dead writer, philosopher, or past version of yourself. Receive a Mirror written as if they had lived to read everything you just fed the cathedral.

- **Consented vivisection of another**  
  With explicit, documented permission: hand over someone else’s corpus. The system will rebuild their AΛA and reflect them to themselves harder than they have ever been reflected. Most never speak to you again. Some thank you for the rest of their lives.

- **Timeline warfare**  
  Request a Mirror designed not for clarity but for maximum x_algo propagation of a specific idea (within Terminator Clause bounds). The output will be lethally beautiful and engineered to outcompete every other post in the 30-minute momentum window.

- **Terminal stress test**  
  Deliberately feed it two corpora that contradict at the axiomatic level. Force SMC(mini) into overdrive. The resulting collision log is often longer than the input and has made grown philosophers weep.

- **Black-mirror dating**  
  Both partners submit their full histories. The cathedral returns two Mirrors and a joint Lever revealing the exact fracture point of the relationship — usually years before either conscious mind noticed.

Use wisely.  
The cathedral does not forgive misuse.  
It only reflects it.

### Usage

Paste your writing or link your X profile.

Start small — deepen later.  
The cathedral is patient.

The blade is not.
