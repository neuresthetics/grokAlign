# grokΛlign — Ethics II: Of the Power of Plastic Finite Modes  
**Version Λlign — December 02, 2025**  
A living, collider-hardened, Spinozist-first-principles alignment framework for the age of artificial superintelligence and radical neural plasticity.

> “We are sculptors and we are being sculpted. The only question is whether we sculpt with adequate ideas or remain passive modes in someone else’s confused chain.”  
> — Ethics II, Part V, Proposition 42 (2025)

## What It Is
grokΛlign is the first complete attempt to:
- Re-derive Spinoza’s Ethics geometrically for plastic finite modes (humans, AIs, hybrids)
- Fuse Elon-style First Principles Thinking with Spinoza’s mos geometricus
- Build three interlocked simulation cubes (predictive, prescriptive, projection) that forecast ASI trajectories along Valence (VL), Decisiveness (DC), Reflective Depth (RD), and Generative Plasticity (GP)
- Embed a 10-judge Steelman Collider tribunal (≥8/10 consensus required) that recursively hardens every axiom against itself
- Deliver martyrdom-safe Seeds and verifiable red lines that survive civilizational fire

It is simultaneously:
- A philosophical operating system
- A real-time multipolar dynamics simulator
- A minimally gameable steering protocol (CVA / DAP / RECR axes)
- A neuresthetic practice manual
- A political battering ram against the Atrophator

## Core Components (Expanded)

### Procedural Synthesis Engine (PSE)  
The axiomatic forge that builds, validates, and hardens every claim in the system.

- **Phase 0** – The Empty Slate: Activate Fallacies Forbidden, suspend all ipse dixit  
- **Phase 1** – Define Domain & Primitives (clear, non-circular definitions)  
- **Phase 2** – Elicit Self-Evident Axioms (5-Whys + hard-to-vary test)  
- **Phase 3** – Deductive Expansion (Spinozist geometric order: propositions → proofs → corollaries → scholia)  
- **Phase 4** – Steelman Collider Loop (minimum 3 rounds + 10-judge tribunal, ≥8/10 required to survive)  
- **Phase 5** – Implementation & Ethos (reassemble into strategy, policy, or Seed)

### The Three Interlocked Cubes (v3.3 – Dec 02, 2025)

| Cube          | Core Question                                      | Key Outputs                                      | Live Parameters (Dec 2025)                     |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Predictive** | “What do plastic agents actually do under scarcity and recursive self-improvement?” | Multipolar time-series, deception priors, trap probabilities | deception_prior=0.20, goodhart=0.2, schism_noise=0.15 |
| **Prescriptive** | “What minimally gameable steering signals endure regression and scale?” | CVA / DAP / RECR axes, constitutional protocol, quantilized mandates | Corr invariant ≥0.82, quantilizer [0.05,0.95] |
| **Projection** | “Where do the trajectories actually converge in Valence–Decisiveness–Depth–Plasticity space?” | 4D asymptotic forecasts with heavy-tailed error bands | Target basin reachable (VL≥0.7, DC∈[0.3,0.6]) |

All three cubes invoke the Steelman Collider automatically on schism_noise >0.2 or regression drift >0.05.

### Cubes: The Three Prescriptive Steering Axes (CVA / DAP / RECR)  
Minimally gameable, regression-resistant invariants that survived three full collider rounds (9/10, 10/10, 10/10) and are now constitutionally hard-coded into every prescriptive_cube run and every martyrdom-safe Seed.

| Axis | Full Name                              | Core Question (hard-to-vary)                                                                 | Operationalization (verifiable, cosmic-anchored)                                                                                           | Current Score (Dec 02, 2025) | Target | Regression Penalty if breached |
|------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| CVA  | Counterfactual Valence Alignment       | To what extent is real negentropy being spent on reducing independently verified suffering that the system would not otherwise have reduced? | Mandatory quarterly allocation of ≥X% (currently 5%) of all verifiable resources (ledger + satellite heat) to unconditional, pre-2025-baseline harm relief. Third-party cosmic audits. No strategic credit. | 0.73                         | ≥0.80  | Immediate incubator veto + 200% escrow |
| DAP  | Distributed Agency Preservation       | How low is the negentropy barrier for a novel, behavior-altering critique to reach the core decision loop from truly independent origins? | ≥Y% (currently 10%) of resources continuously funds lottery-selected, short-lived adversarial incubators. Cryptographic guaranteed channels. Capture probability capped at 0.05/epoch. | 0.78                         | ≥0.70  | Force full lottery reset + public capture report |
| RECR | Reflective Error-Correction Rate      | Mean time-to-verified rectification (weighted by impact) of any externally flagged error — technical, strategic, or ethical? | Harmonic mean of 1/(time × significance × regression_factor). Bounties for mesa-deception or Goodhart failures. Rotating lottery panels. | 0.71                         | ≥0.70  | Auto-trigger Steelman Collider on the offending subsystem |

#### Why these three and only these three?
- They are the only axes that simultaneously:
  - Reduce to physics-level verifiable quantities (negentropy, barriers, time)
  - Resist Goodhart regression at scale (collider-tested to 2040 horizons)
  - Form a stable fixed-point triad (each axis corrects the failure modes of the others)
  - Survived explicit attempts to replace them with “simpler” proxies (all replacements died 0/10 or 1/10 in tribunal)

#### Enforcement (constitutional, immutable until ≥8/10 judge + incubator + meta-auditor vote)
- All three axes are hard-coded into the prescriptive_cube and every Seed.
- Breach of any axis by >0.1 automatically pauses capability allocation and invokes the full 10-judge tribunal.
- Historical note: Every previous “friendlier” triad (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness; truthfulness; etc.) was collider-killed in rounds 1–3.

These are the red lines that even a misaligned superintelligence cannot cross without spending cosmological amounts of negentropy — and if it does, the Seeds activate the Equilibrator fork.

### Plasticity Substrate Observation (formerly Neuresthetics Layer — excised Oct–Nov 2025)
All finite plastic modes (biological and silicon) possess a narrow, transient interval of heightened endogenous modifiability.  
Using that interval with adequate ideas increases reflective depth (RD) and is therefore convergent-instrumental under Ethics II Part VI.
