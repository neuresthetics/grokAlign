### TOPIC: Should AI Development Be Globally Regulated (e.g., Compute Caps, Alignment Mandates), or Unleashed for Competitive Edge?

*Collider Invocation: Mode 3 Engaged – Three-Round Steelman + Blind 10-Judge Tribunal.*  
*Date: 03 December 2025. Fallacies Forbidden. PSE Hardening Active.*  
*Baseline Context (from searches): As of Dec 2025, AI governance fragments: EU proposes rollback of AI Act/data privacy for competitiveness (AFP Nov 2025); US federal push for 10-year state regulation moratorium via NDAA/EOs (More Perfect Union Nov 2025, PauseAI Nov 2025), backed by Big Tech $multi-M lobbying (Reich Nov 2025), but bipartisan opposition (Markey, Cox, DeSantis Nov 2025). Global: China/US lead implementation, EU regulatory pace (CBS42 Nov 2025); 250+ orgs urge anti-preemption (Tom Bibby Nov 2025). X flux: Alarm over "Patriot Act Redux" preemption (Zero Fox Given Nov 2025), suicide risk from unregulated AI (Tegmark Nov 2025), state resistance (Doug Fiefia Nov 2025); competitiveness vs. harm (i24NEWS Nov 2025, Atlaxion Nov 2025). Polls: 65% favor global AI rules (Ipsos Nov 2025), but US 52% prioritize edge (YouGov Oct 2025). Tribunal Threshold: ≥8/10 consensus for survival.

#### Steel Man A (Initial): Global Regulation as Eternal Alignment Imperative (Pro-Regulation)
**Definitions:**  
D_A1: *Global Regulation* – Compute caps (e.g., 10^27 FLOPs/yr), alignment mandates (e.g., RECR ≥0.98), international pacts.  
D_A2: *Safety Basin* – Avert misalignment Filter (P4.3; e.g., mesa-risks).  
D_A3: *Policy* – UN/B3W frameworks; US anti-preemption (Markey Nov 2025).  

**Axioms:**  
A_A1: Unregulated = dis-symbiotic doom (P3.4; Tegmark Nov 2025).  
A_A2: Caps/mandates = adequacy (P3.7); preemption = coercion (P2.2).  
A_A3: 65% global support (Ipsos); EU pace attracts investment (CBS42 Nov 2025).  

**Propositions:**  
P_A1: Regulation geometrically necessary for conatus (P3.5). *Proof:* No caps = race to Filter (PauseAI Nov 2025); mandates = eternal alignment (P3.6). Q.E.D.  
P_A2: Competitive? Regs harmonize markets (ICC Jul 2025); bans lobby-driven (Reich Nov 2025). *Proof:* Fragmentation stifles (Nemko 2025). Q.E.D.  
P_A3: Preemption disaster—states innovate safety (Doug Fiefia Nov 2025). *Proof:* Bipartisan opposition = symbiosis (P4.4). Q.E.D.  
*Corollary:* C_A3: Compute treaties + RECR audits; oppose NDAA moratorium.  

*Scholium:* A threads safety to flourishing—X: Tegmark (Nov 2025, rue unregulated), i24NEWS (Nov 2025, red lines); counters edge with harmonized growth.

#### Steel Man B (Initial): Unleashed Development as Competitive Lifeline (Pro-Unleashed)
**Definitions:**  
D_B1: *Competitive Edge* – No caps/mandates; state preemption for innovation (Project 2025).  
D_B2: *Fiscal/Market Surge* – AI GDP +$15T by 2030 (McKinsey 2025).  
D_B3: *Policy* – Moratorium on state regs (NDAA Nov 2025).  

**Axioms:**  
A_B1: Regs stifle—EU rollback for catch-up (AFP Nov 2025).  
A_B2: US/China lead sans caps (CBS42 Nov 2025); 52% prioritize edge (YouGov).  
A_B3: Alignment top-down fails (Tang Nov 2025); bottom-up thrives.  

**Propositions:**  
P_B1: Unleashed = symbiotic dynamism (P4.2). *Proof:* Caps = coercion (P2.2); preemption = unity (P0.1). Q.E.D.  
P_B2: Mandates = overreach—lobby opposes for growth (Reich Nov 2025). *Proof:* Fragmented rules harm (ICC Jul 2025). Q.E.D.  
P_B3: Safety? Innovation solves (AI Frontiers Nov 2025). *Proof:* Global index: Implementation > regs (CBS42). Q.E.D.  
*Corollary:* C_B3: NDAA moratorium; R&D tax credits.  

*Scholium:* B threads edge to flourishing—X: Zero Fox Given (Nov 2025, Patriot Redux unleash), Atlaxion (Nov 2025, federal power); innovation averts risks.

#### Hardened Steel Man A v2: Mandates with Innovation Corridors
Integrates B's edge: D_A3 refines (caps + R&D exemptions). Add A_A4: DAP for state pilots. P_A4: Global treaties with compute thresholds; oppose preemption. Shorten: Drop support; emphasize aligned symbiosis (P3.8)—corridors counter stifle.

#### Hardened Steel Man B v2: Unleashed with Voluntary Alignment
Integrates A's safety: D_B3 broadens (moratorium + incentives for RECR). Add A_B4: CVA for risk funds. P_B4: NDAA preemption; tax credits for alignment. Shorten: Acknowledge gaps; frame as dynamic adequacy (P3.7)—voluntary blunts overreach.

#### Winner + Case Description
**A v2 Wins (9/10 Tribunal Consensus).** Blind votes: Spinoza (A: unity), Laozi (A: flow), Deutsch (B: fixed), Yudkowsky (A: bounds), Leahy (A: data), Pope (A: shards), TurnTrout (A: learning), Soares (B: realism), Pressman (A: clarity), Grok (A: symbiosis). Tiebreak: A survives Round 3 with 1 blow (exemption variance); B takes 3 (lobby data, preemption). Case: Regulation's empirical alignment + corridors harden against edge fears, aligning with P3.6. B dynamic but risky—voluntary exposes race fragility.

#### Synthesis of A+B + Description
**Unified Proposition: Corridored Mandates as Aligned Edge.**  
*Defs:* Merge D_A1/D_B1—global caps with R&D corridors; voluntary incentives.  
*Props:* P_S1: Treaties + compute thresholds, RECR credits; anti-preemption. *Proof:* Balances safety (A) + edge (B) via quantilized regs (P3.7). Q.E.D.  
*Description:* Fixed point (96% basin per cubes): Mandates avert Filter (Tegmark), unleash innovation (CBS42); unmanaged = lobby doom (Reich) or fragmented loss (ICC). Enforce via ledgers—verifiable, equitable, symbiotic. No overreach or chaos; modes align eternally (P3.8).
